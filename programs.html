                    <p class="progr-p3">The Directorate of Private Sector Exchange (Private Sector) is pleased to announce an initiative for College and University Student-category exchange visitors participating in academic training in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). We introduce this opportunity in response to the recent Joint Statement of Principles in Support of International Education.</p>

                    <h4 class="progr-ht">Early Career STEM Research Initiative</h4>

                    <p class="progr-p3">This research initiative seeks to support an increase in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students, professionals, and exchange visitors on educational and cultural exchange programs in the United States.<br><br>
                                         Each year, thousands of communities across the United States welcome international visitors into their homes, schools, and businesses. That person-to-person interaction, exemplifying citizen diplomacy, ensures that Americans and international visitors learn about each other’s culture and way of life. Hosting an exchange visitor builds your institution’s international credibility, stature, and brand, positively affecting the lives of future professionals across borders, creating and strengthening your overseas network to partner organizations, and setting your institution apart from the competition with innovative ideas and perspectives.

                    <p class="progr-p3">This research initiative seeks to support an increase in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students, professionals, and exchange visitors on educational and cultural exchange programs in the United States.<br><br> Each year, thousands of communities across the United States welcome international visitors into their homes, schools, and businesses. That person-to-person interaction, exemplifying citizen diplomacy, ensures that Americans and international visitors learn about each other’s culture and way of life. Hosting an exchange visitor builds your institution’s international credibility, stature, and brand, positively affecting the lives of future professionals across borders, creating and strengthening your overseas network to partner organizations, and setting your institution apart from the competition with innovative ideas and perspectives.</p>

                    <ul class="progr-li">
                        <li>Interested host sites/STEM businesses should reach out to BridgeUSA Sponsors (ECA’s implementing partners for exchanges) to determine the best fit.</li><br>
                        <li>Sponsors and hosts will follow their own internal procedures and applicable regulations to operationalize an exchange.</li><br>
                        <li>Host organizations may enter into agreements with their selected sponsors to identify the appropriate J-1 category and eligible candidates. J-1 categories include: College/University Student, Intern, Professor, Research Scholar, Short-Term Scholar, Specialist, and Trainee.</li><br>
                        <li>STEM host organizations identify suitable positions, relevant educational and cultural exchange experiences, and resources, e.e., fully funding an exchange or offering a hybrid approach where the exchange visitor pays for some of the programming costs.</li><br>
                        <li>Sponsors recruit, screen, and offer STEM host candidates to review for suitability e.g., interviews and resume reviews.</li><br>
                        <li>Once STEM host identifies the best match for their opportunity, the partnering sponsor will issue the necessary documents for the exchange visitor to apply for their J-1 visa.</li><br>
                        <li>Upon arrival, the partnering sponsor will continue to monitor the exchange visitor’s time with the STEM host organization.</li>
